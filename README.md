## The Problem

When Claude shows "Thinking..." for minutes, you're flying blind. Is it stuck? Making progress? About to hit context limits?

## The Solution

Claude HUD gives you **X-ray vision** into Claude's work:

| What You See | Why It Matters |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Context health** | Know exactly how full your context window is before it's too late |
| **Tool activity** | Watch Claude read, edit, and search files as it happens |
| **Agent tracking** | See which subagents are running and what they're doing |
| **Todo progress** | Track task completion in real-time |

## What Each Line Shows

### Session Info
```
[Opus 4.5] ████░░░░░░ 19% | 2 CLAUDE.md | 8 rules | 6 MCPs | 6 hooks | ⏱️ 1m
```
- **Model** — Current model in use
- **Context bar** — Visual meter with color coding (green → yellow → red as it fills)
- **Config counts** — Rules, MCPs, and hooks loaded
- **Duration** — How long the session has been running

### Tool Activity
```
✓ TaskOutput ×2 | ✓ mcp_context7 ×1 | ✓ Glob ×1 | ✓ Skill ×1
```
- **Running tools** show a spinner with the target file
- **Completed tools** aggregate by type with counts

### Agent Status
```
✓ Explore: Explore home directory structure (5s)
✓ open-source-librarian: Research React hooks patterns (2s)
```
- **Agent type** and what it's working on
- **Elapsed time** for each agent

### Todo Progress
```
✓ All todos complete (5/5)
```
- **Current task** or completion status
- **Progress counter** (completed/total)

## How It Works

Claude HUD uses Claude Code's native **statusline API** — no separate window, no tmux required, works in any terminal.

```
Claude Code → stdin JSON → claude-hud → stdout → displayed in your terminal
           ↘ transcript JSONL (tools, agents, todos)
```

**Key features:**
- Native token data from Claude Code (not estimated)
- Parses the transcript for tool/agent activity
- Updates every ~300ms
- Zero configuration required

---
